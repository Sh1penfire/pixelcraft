    "description": "Welcome to pixelcraft, a mod which gives an alternative to vanilla, and adds lore surounding such world. Copper and Lead are almost overused in mod content, so lets change that. \nPixelcraft adds two new main materiels, 15 new maps(around), a new planet to explore, 99 new buildable blocks, 7 new environmental blocks and multiple unit factions. \n Hope you have a good time using the mod, and I'll hopefully finish a few of the missing sprites.\ndiscord: https://discord.gg/xwq8hU5Ww8",
