To fix
-Neromagnet drill (All of it, the base, rotor etc)
-Panic (frick that sprite, it isn't mine, I'll redesign)
-LTG (Requries a bit more work, I'll redo the decals a slight bit)
-Cores (Requires redo of decal, and maybe even pallet. Core-beacon needs to go though)
-Bio Press (I'm thinking I'll keep pallet, but general shape is ;~:)
-Bio drill (Flat, and has lot of small details. Probibly will redo, keep similar design but not at all)
-Ioniser (Decalless for the most part, requires some work)
-Sand sifter and extracter (Both are heresy that I need to fix :P)
Managed to redo extractor, rotors need work
-Bionite mixer
Done! Made the decals thicker and cap less messy
-Volatile generator
Done! :D Looks better for something which crafts explosive fluid

-Taconite Pulveriser and crusher (I still want to make them flat, but in a way that makes sense, since they're my bridges on deep water for now)
-Pixelite mixer (Old piece of heresy that has just got to go)
-Coal compresser (Blatent resprite, pankiwi did it but that dosn't mean that :~:)
Flin finished it :D

-Magnitine forgery (Depixelise it, change shape)
Worked on base sprite, Flin finished :D

-Old sprites (Moving to a texture pack or deleting. Theres mostly no reason for those to exist anymore, I've moved on)

-Blaze (New pallet, new shape, it looks like salvo rip)
Done by Esc :D

-Beat (Resprited laser gun, requires a lot of time and care)

-Chambrella (Decals are aquward and flat)

-Point (Way to small, and detail inconsistance)
Esc made sprite for new point :D

-Tenemotus (Requires more details, feels kind of out of place currently, and ae)
-Stir fuse (Keep style, resprite)

-Most unit blocks (All of them need to have some work put into it, and style change)

-Bionite (Not my sprite, yet requires redo. Colour and decal change in order)
-Feromagnet (Shape change, but that's mostly it)
-Magnitine (Angles are wrong, general pallet is somewhat fine)
-Rubble (An untold power lie within, definitely not with it's looks. Requires redo to make it less flat)

-Mechnical life and Voidics (A bit to messy/no cell)
-Nescience (Small decals with weapons)
-Rusty dart (Way to messy with decals, should tone them down a bit)
-t2 and t3 crystal units (Blatent resprites, requires more unique, similar to crystal)
-Crystal (Less sharp shape, cell sprite, cleanup requried)
